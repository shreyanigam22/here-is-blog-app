            Nature is made of everything we see around us – trees, flowers,
             plants, animals, sky, mountains, forests and more. Human beings depend 
             on nature to stay alive. Nature helps us breathe, gives us food, water, shelter,
             medicines, and clothes. We find many colors in nature which make the Earth beautiful.
